# hello-world

Just following the [on-line guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to learn about Git.
I also want to understand more about the entire GitHub eco-system.

This changed was made on the readme-edits branch, directly via the website interface. I need to keep the paragraph break behavior straight between how *GitHub* acts versus other *markdown* processors.
